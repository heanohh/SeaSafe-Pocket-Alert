# SeaSafe-Pocket-Alert
James Dyson 2024
SeaSafe Pocket Alert detects air pockets when a ship capsizes, indicating their location with LED lights. It helps panicked people find safety near air pockets during ship flooding. Especially for small vessels with shorter golden time and frequent capsizing.

We made it based on Arduino Uno system.
